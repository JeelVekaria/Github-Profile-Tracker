# Github-Profile-Tracker

GitHub Profile Tracker is a web application that allows users to track and display GitHub profile information in an organized and user-friendly manner. This project is built with React JS and powered by Vite for fast and optimized development. The backend is handled with Node.js, and data fetching is achieved through Axios, a promise-based HTTP client. The application interacts with the GitHub API to retrieve real-time data about user profiles.

## Features
- User Search: Enter a GitHub username to fetch and display profile information.
- Profile Details: View detailed information including the user's avatar, bio, repository count, follower count, following count, and more.
- Error Handling: Takes care of situations where user inputs invalid usernames

## Technologies Used
- React JS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Vite: A fast development build tool that significantly improves the speed of development by leveraging native ES modules and modern browser features.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, used to make HTTP requests to the GitHub API.
